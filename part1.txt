=== Issue 1: Version should be a string ===

Problem: 
- In the docker-compose.yaml, you didnt specify version value as a string

Solution:
- add quotes around the value. For eg, version: '3'


=== Issue 2: The network key should be specified as a list

Problem:
- In the docker-compose.yaml, because we are using Docker Compose version 3, the networks key should be specified as a list

Solution:
- you should modify the networks section in the postgres section following the same format in budibase section. For e.g.

    networks:
      - budibase
