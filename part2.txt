=== Issue: Incorrect Hostname ===

Problem: 
- The "connect ECONNREFUSED" error message indicates that Budibase is trying to connect to the PostgreSQL database server at the address "127.0.0.1" on port "5432," but it's unable to establish a connection

Solution:
- You need to ensure that Budibase uses the correct hostname or IP address for the PostgreSQL server.
From whats specificied on your docker-compose file, the 'Host' would be "postgres" so,
changing "localhost" to "postgres" will resolve this
